Need to sell access to a specific page or post through WooCommerce 2.xx?  This is the plugin for you.

== Description ==
I looked everywhere and I couldn\'t find a plugin already out there, free or premium that would do the simple fact of selling access to a particular page or post through WooCommerce.  So I decided to write my own.

This plugin creates a custom field which you simply need to fill in the product id number which is needed to be purchased to view the post. 

It checks to make sure the user is logged in, AND has purchased that particular product before.  If they have, they see the general post content.  If they have NOT purchased they are then displayed a Oops page with a buy now button for the product.

It seemed like a no brainer to me.

== Installation ==
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Go to Page or Post and you should see a field to enter in your product ID.
